### 1. Accelerated Download Speed
IDM uses intelligent dynamic file segmentation technology to accelerate download speeds by up to 5 times. It breaks files into smaller parts and downloads them simultaneously, ensuring faster and more reliable performance compared to regular browser downloads.

### 2. Support for All File Types
Whether you're downloading videos, software, compressed files, or documents, IDM supports a wide range of file formats. It integrates seamlessly with all popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera to auto-detect downloadable content.

### 3. Pause and Resume Downloads
One of IDM's most useful features is its ability to pause and resume downloads. If your connection drops or you need to shut down your PC, you can continue the download later from where it left offâ€”saving time and bandwidth.

### 4. Scheduled Downloads
With IDM, you can schedule downloads for a specific time. This is ideal for managing multiple large files, automating download tasks, and avoiding network congestion during working hours.

### 5. Built-in Virus Checking
IDM integrates with your antivirus software to ensure all downloaded files are safe and virus-free. This automatic checking helps keep your system protected from harmful or corrupted files.

### 6. Video Grabber Tool
IDM includes a built-in video grabber that detects streaming video from websites like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo. With one click, you can download videos directly from these platforms in your desired resolution and format.

### 7. Drag & Drop and Batch Downloads
You can easily drag and drop links into IDM or import download lists. It also supports batch downloading, allowing you to queue multiple files at once for efficient management and processing.

### 8. Custom Download Categories
Organise your downloads with custom categories such as music, videos, software, or documents. IDM automatically sorts files into these folders, keeping your downloads tidy and easy to locate.

### 9. Proxy and VPN Compatibility
IDM supports a wide variety of proxy servers, FTP, and VPN services. This is especially useful for users who want to download region-locked content or browse anonymously while downloading files.

### 10. No Ads or Bloatware
Unlike many free download managers, IDM is clean and professionalâ€”free of intrusive ads or unnecessary extras. Its lightweight and user-friendly interface focuses solely on performance and productivity.

## 11. Regular Updates and Customer Support
IDM receives regular updates to improve compatibility, speed, and security. Licensed users also have access to official customer support for troubleshooting and queries.

In summary, Internet Download Manager (IDM) is the ultimate tool for anyone who frequently downloads files online. With its powerful features, speed optimisation, and easy integration, IDM ensures your downloading experience is fast, safe, and fully under your control.
